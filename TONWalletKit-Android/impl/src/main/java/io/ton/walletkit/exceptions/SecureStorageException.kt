/**
 * Exception thrown when secure storage operations fail.
 *
 * This sealed class represents failures in secure storage operations on Android, such as
 * EncryptedSharedPreferences, KeyStore, or other secure storage mechanisms.
 *
 * Secure storage is used to store sensitive data such as:
 * - Private keys and mnemonics
 * - Session tokens
 * - Wallet configuration
 * - User preferences
 *
 * This class provides specific error types for different storage operation failures,
 * making it easier to handle and diagnose storage-related issues.
