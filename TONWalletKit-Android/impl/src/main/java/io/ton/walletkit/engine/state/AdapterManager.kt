 * Manages native wallet adapter instances used by the JavaScript bridge.
 *
 * When a host app calls [addWallet(adapter)], the adapter is registered here
 * and an ID is passed to JavaScript. The JS proxy adapter delegates async methods
 * (getStateInit, getSignedSendTransaction, etc.) back to the Kotlin adapter
 * via WebView @JavascriptInterface bridge methods that look up the adapter by ID.
 *
 * The adapter stays on the Kotlin side; JS reaches it through message-based bridge
 * callbacks keyed by the registered ID.
 *
 * @suppress Internal component. Exposed via [WebViewWalletKitEngine] only.
